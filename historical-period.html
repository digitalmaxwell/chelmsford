            <h1 class="heading1">Historical Period (1500-Present)</h1>
            <p class="p--lg">
                By the 1500s, long-established Native exchange networks that reached from the coast to the interior river valleys began to incorporate a few European-made items including cloth, metal objects, and beads, which were repurposed in distinctly indigenous ways. For example, copper kettles were cut apart to make spear points, knife blades, awls, tubular beads, and pendants. They also traded animal furs and other items with European explorers and later with early colonists in coastal fishing and whaling ports. We know about some of these interactions from the writings of English, French, Basque, and Dutch peoples.

            <h3 class="heading3">Early encounters with Europeans</h3>
            <p class="p--lg">
                The earliest encounters of Native people with English explorers were neither positive nor peaceful. Some Native Americans who lived in coastal communities were lured onto ships and kidnapped to be enslaved in Europe. Word of the dangers posed by the deceptive foreigners and their strange weaponry quickly spread. Native populations were drastically reduced in numbers by European-introduced diseases such as smallpox and measles, which killed an estimated 90% of the indigenous population in New England in the early to mid-1600s. Native populations struggled to regroup and recover under restrictions by English colonist-settlers.

            <h3 class="heading3">Passaconaway and the Pequot War</h3>
            <p class="p--lg">
                Passaconaway of the Pennacook (or Pawtucket) group was sachem (leader or chief) of the lower Merrimack River valley, including the area where the Merrimack and Concord rivers meet in Lowell just east of Chelmsford. Native populations continued to live, fish, and farm there under his leadership. Long-established trade and travel routes continued as before. They lived sometimes in village sites but mostly in smaller places within their ancestral homelands. The Pawtucket interacted with groups led by other sachems in other parts of Massachusetts and in areas that are now Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. They would gather for protection from attacks by other indigenous groups, including the Mohawk people to the west.

            <p class="p--lg">
                In what is now southern New England, many indigenous peoples died during the Pequot War of 1636–1638. The Pequot Tribe in the southern Connecticut River valley and their tribal allies were fighting the English colonists and their tribal allies to the east and north. When the colonists defeated the Pequots, many Native men, women, and children became enslaved servants in English households and more of their ancestors’ land was taken.

            <h3 class="heading3">English Settlement in Chelmsford</h3>
            <p class="p--lg">
                In 1652, a group of 20 English colonists from Concord and Woburn moved to what is now Chelmsford. At that time, the Reverend John Eliot of Roxbury, a Puritan missionary to the local Native Americans, also wanted the same land as the colonists. This Great Neck was the location of Pawtucket Indian wetuwomash (wigwams) and gardens. On May 18, 1653, the General Court of Massachusetts Bay granted lands (called plantations) for the English and the Pawtucket. The English plantation was named Chelmsford after the town of the same name in Essex County, England. The Native population settled into Christian Indian communities called Praying Indian Towns or Villages, set up by the Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1651 and 1674. The Praying Villages founded by Eliot in this area were called Pawtucket and Wamesit, around the falls on the Concord River and the Merrimack River in present-day Lowell.

            <p class="p--lg">
                In 1674, about 250 Native Pawtucket lived in the lower Merrimack River drainage. This number included 15 families (about 75 people) at Wamesit, which had been combined with the Pawtucket praying Indian village and enlarged in 1656 and 1660. In 1675–1676, a war between the English colonists and the Wampanoag sachem Metacom (known as King Philip to the English) and his allies displaced many of the indigenous people living at Wamesit and throughout southern New England. After the war, many Native men, women, and children were enslaved here and in the Caribbean, while African and Caribbean peoples were brought to New England and also sold as slaves.

            <h3 class="heading3">Continuity of Pawtucket Identity in the 19th and 20th Centuries</h3>
            <p class="p--lg">
                In 1677, the native Wamesit village in Lowell was disbanded by the General Court of Massachusetts. Many Pawtuckets, including those who had been Christianized, moved north to Canada during and after King Philip’s War. Others returned to their traditional homelands in the lower Merrimack River drainage (Chelmsford-Lowell area). Native men found their way in the local English economy by working as tenant farmers, hired servants, and farmworkers. Others participated as soldiers during the Imperial wars in eighteenth-century Europe among the English, French, Dutch, and Spanish. During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) in the colonies, men of Native and African ancestry also joined the Continental Army under General George Washington.

            <p class="p--lg">
                In the 1800s and 1900s, Native men, women, and children identifying as descendants of the Pawtucket people continued to live and work in the lower Merrimack River drainage. Groups like the Greater Lowell Indian Cultural Association (GLICA) and the United Native American Cultural Center (UNACC) in north-central Massachusetts have been formed by Native people to help keep past indigenous cultures and traditions alive for current and future generations of Pawtucket descendants and the region at large.

            body="One of the more notable Native activists in north-central Massachusetts was Edward J. “Onkwe Tase” Guillemette who started the GLICA in the 1970s. He was part Mohawk and a long-time resident of Dracut, Massachusetts. As a member of the U.S. Army during World War II, he landed at the beaches in Normandy, France on D-Day, and served in Europe under General George S. Patton. In 1974, Onkwe Tase, which means “man who comes around,” became the first Commissioner on Indian Affairs in Massachusetts to help protect the rights of indigenous people."
            body2="In 1993, he left the GLICA to help start the United Native American Cultural Center (UNACC) at the former Fort Devens. The center provides a place for natives and non-natives to gather, share, and learn about peoples of all cultures. It hosts cultural events, including Powwows, fall feasts, and unity days. The center also does program collaborations with the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archeology in Andover at the Phillips Academy, and the Fruitlands Museum of Harvard, MA."

            <h3 class="heading3">The Persistence of Native American Heritage and Identities in New England</h3>
            <p class="p--lg">
                The presence, persistence, and preservation of Native American heritage and identities both here and elsewhere in New England are testimony to the determined men and women who resisted centuries of cultural assimilation. Since the early 1980s, the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head/Aquinnah, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and Narraganset Indian Tribe have attained federal recognition as Sovereign Nations with their own government and lands. Some groups, such as the Nipmuc Nation, have come together and achieved state recognition with their own tribal government and constitution ratified by their citizens in 2003. Organizations such as the GLICA and UNACC provide ways for indigenous people in Massachusetts and throughout New England today to share their ancestry and cultural traditions. Although there are members of the community who still reside in the area now known as New England, there were many tribes forced out of the region. Although no longer physically present, they still continue to have an interest in the locations where they once lived.
