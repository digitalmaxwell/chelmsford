                This tribe, also known as the People of the First Light, has inhabited present-day Massachusetts and eastern Rhode Island for more than 12,000 years. It was re-acknowledged as a federally recognized tribe in 2007. In 2015, the federal government declared 150 acres in Mashpee and 170 acres in Taunton as the Tribe's initial reservation, on which it can exercise its full tribal sovereignty rights.

                This Tribe's ancestral lands have always been on the southwestern end of Noepe (Martha's Vineyard), even after the Town of Gay Head was incorporated in 1870 under Commonwealth law. In 1972, the Wampanoag Tribal Council of Gay Head, Inc. was formed to promote self-determination among Wampanoag people, to ensure preservation and continuation of Wampanoag history and culture, and to seek the return of Tribal lands to the Wampanoag people. In 1987, the Tribe obtained federal recognition by an act of Congress, and approximately 485 acres were purchased as Tribal Lands.
