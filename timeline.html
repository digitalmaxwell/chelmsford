                    Archaeologists have arranged their understandings of the development of ancient indigenous peoples in the Northeast using what are called temporal periods, designated as PaleoIndian, Archaic, Woodland, and Historical. These periods span more than 12,000 years. Archaeologists use these divisions to help organize their understandings of what types of tools indigenous peoples made and used, what they ate, how and where they lived, how they organized themselves in larger or smaller groups, and their connections and interactions with peoples and places in other regions.

                    It is important to know that these archaeological temporal periods are based on European-derived ideas about marking time linearly, which is different from traditional indigenous ideas that emphasize ancient connections and contemporary continuities. In fact, archaeological findings show that people made and used similar-looking tools and developed technologies for food, shelter, heat, clothing, and transportation that hardly changed over many thousands of years, and which were common to ways that indigenous people lived in a vast area of eastern North America. Because of the many similarities that occur throughout the temporal periods, archaeologists use a variety of methods to date activity areas, including <i>radiocarbon dating</i> done on charcoal, shell, or bone.
