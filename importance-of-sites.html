            <p class="p--lg">
                Archaeological sites are places where evidence of past human activity has been found. This evidence can be anything that has been made, used, or changed by humans, such as a fire hearth, a trash pit, a stone toolmaking location, or the traces of a wigwam Unfortunately, archaeological sites are often destroyed when the land is disturbed by housing and business development, road construction, and other activities.

            <p class="p--lg">
                Objects from an archaeological site have little meaning unless they can be related to specific soil layers (stratigraphy) and associated with other evidence of human activity. Archaeologists call this context. Any activity that disturbs the soil may destroy this context and the siteâ€™s scientific and historic value. Professional archaeologists search the ground surface and the soils to record information about past lifeways and recover artifacts for study in a laboratory. The work is done carefully to preserve the site, if possible.

                Archaeological sites have been found in the Chelmsford area and elsewhere along the lower Merrimack River drainage. The Merrimack River was used by Native Americans during their seasonal or yearly rounds when they fished, hunted, and collected plants. Archaeologists have found examples of toolmaking. These tools include projectile points, scrapers, axes, adzes, gouges, awls, and needles used to work animal hides, bone, wood, and other materials to make clothing, structures, tools, and boats.

            body="Making a stone spear point starts with reducing a large stone (or core) by taking off large and then smaller pieces (called shatter). Very small flakes are removed next. Stone toolmaking can create hundreds of pieces of debitage (or chipping debris). Archaeologists often can figure out the age and type of a site from chipping debris."
