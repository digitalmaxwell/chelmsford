                <p class="p--lg">
                    Archaeologists usually dig holes in the ground that are 50 centimeters (cm) square (about 20 inches on each side) to look at the layers of soil and to search for artifacts. These test pits are dug carefully with a shovel in 10-cm (4-inch) levels to about 100 cm (40 inches) below the surface. Sometimes they need to dig hundreds of these test pits in an area they expect might have an archaeological site.

                <p class="p--lg">
                    All the soil is removed from each test pit and sifted through wire-mesh screens. Archaeologists collect any pieces of stone tools and small flakes and shatter from toolmaking or other items such as pieces of ceramic vessels.

                    Archaeologists take the artifacts they collect in the field back to their laboratory to clean, study, and catalog. During the cleaning process, archaeologists use a dry brush to clean porous materials such as pottery, shells, and animal bone to prevent damage. Other materials, such as chipping debris and fire-cracked rock, can be cleaned with water and soft bristle brushes.
