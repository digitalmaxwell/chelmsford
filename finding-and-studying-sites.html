            <p class="p--lg">
                Archaeologists usually dig holes in the ground that are 50 centimeters (cm) square (about 20 inches on each side) to look at the layers of soil and to search for artifacts. These test pits are dug carefully with a shovel in 10-cm (4-inch) levels to about 100 cm (40 inches) below the surface. Sometimes they need to dig hundreds of these test pits in an area they expect might have an archaeological site.
            </p>
            <p class="p--lg">
                All the soil is removed from each test pit and sifted through wire-mesh screens. Archaeologists collect any pieces of stone tools and small flakes and shatter from toolmaking or other items such as pieces of ceramic vessels.
